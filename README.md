# API

API or Accurate Planetary Information is a web application that allows users to view information about the planets in the Star Wars universe. The application was built using Vue 3 and Vite and it consumes the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) API (specifically the [planets](https://swapi.dev/api/planets/) endpoint).
This application is part of a development challenge, and so the scope of the project is limited to the following:

* Display a list of planets
* Display a planet's details
* Sort the list of planets by name
* Paginate the list of planets

There are improvements that can be made to the application but due to time constraints, they were not implemented. Also, since this is a development challenge, the application is not production-ready. Therefore, in order to run the application, you will need to follow the instructions below.


## Project Setup
